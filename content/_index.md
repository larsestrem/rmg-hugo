Risk-Mitigation.Group is the parent company of websites listed below.

[FireDepartment.net](https://www.firedepartment.net/) - Helping fire departments get online, recruit volunteers & share information with the communities they serve. Fire administrators and firefighters can scroll to the bottom of their fire department profile and request to manage their fire department's profile. Community members and insurance agents can also suggest additions and updates that will be reviewed before being added to the database.

[FireInsurance.Report](https://fireinsurance.report/) - Services designed to help insurance agents find the nearest fire station and nearest fire hydrant for insurance inspections and underwriting. When either a hydrant or fire station can't be found, insurance professions often call the fire station requesting more information. FireInsurance.Report services saves a significant amount of time for the insurance industry and firefighters.
